General description of the goal or purpose:
Story based game where a user will go through a game. Each part of the story will have a graphic and some number of choices to move onto the next part. The story will have a number of different endings for people to play through.

Anticipated file structure:
Multiple classes and methods that we can combine the different parts of the game to create possible storylines to work through with different endings and possible achievements. There would also be a player class. Finally there would be a main class to play through the game which would call parts of other classes which can be written with different branches of the story.

New Java:
The program would be using a graphic for each branch of the story as the screen would display the graphic/image as well as a text part of the story before taking user input to determine the next choice is and then it will transition to the next page and continue going until they reach the end of the story trough their choices (either death/fail or success).

Division of labor:

The length and content of the story can be changed and different storylines can merge/split depending on the timeline and how long the project takes so if there is too much or too little time it is easy to manage

Different roles:

1. Planning the story then coding it into classes where the different classes are perhaps different types of endings
2. Creating the graphics for each of the stories and if there is time create good transitions between the graphics
3. Creating the player class
4. Creating the main class
